TSQLViewer
==========

Learning to bind Java &amp; MySQL

2014 Taavi JÃ¤rv

TSQLViewer (Taavi's SQL Viewer) is a part of my new project, which's purpose is to learn more, have fun and build
more personalized utilities for PC (mainly planned for my personal use. And, when i start uploading source files, people will have
an opportunity to learn how to or how NOT to use various Java features and libraries.)
What about TSQLViewer?

It's a simple tool to extract database info from remote MySQL database servers and give the user chance to view and change 
database contents. 
I felt like it's too much for me to log in to my host's cpanel, then to another panel and then to PHPMyAdmin. 
Lazyness is the best motivator!

Will build the GUI with JavaFX and i'm so excited. And i just won't hide it.
